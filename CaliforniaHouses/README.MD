# Overview 

In this model, my goal was to familiarize myself with Machine Learning. This includes Sklearn, Numpy, Matplot, and Pandas

This model currently shows multiple varibles that are associated with the housing prices in california. The end goal of the program is to train a model that predicts the housing prices based on these varibles, producing a multivariate regression model. 

This code was produced by following along in the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" written by Aurelien Geron.
